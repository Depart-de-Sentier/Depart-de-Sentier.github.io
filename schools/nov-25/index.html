        <h5>Course overview</h5>
        <p>Research in life cycle assessment (LCA) and material flow analysis (MFA) has exploded in the last ten years, and the power, flexibility, and availability of open source tools and data has as well. In this course, we will couple <a href="https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM">ODYM</a> and <a href="https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/">Brightway</a>, and see how the combination can both inspire and improve the methods and results of MFA and LCA. We will also learn about open source development and publication.</p>
        <p>This course content will be based on the DdS <a href="https://www.d-d-s.ch/schools/june-25/">Summer School in Singapore</a>, but will include updates based on the lessons learned at that school and advancements in software.</p>
        <p>Taking the research needs of prospective LCA as a starting point, we will demonstrate how MFA concepts like material composition and the difference between stocks and flows can be applied to common LCA databases to check data quality, generate new inventories, and understand system effects outside of individual unit processes.</p>
        <p>To make such analysis easier to share and interpret, we will also learn about how to turn Python product system models into interactive dashboards using <a href="https://panel.holoviz.org/">Panel</a>. We will also briefly review how to create, test, document, and publish open source software.</p>
        <p>The structure of the school starts with a half-day introduction and Python refresher on Sunday, followed by two days of interactive teaching sessions using Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks include exercises, and we will discuss the solutions in class. From Wednesday to Friday, you will work in small groups of around six people and apply these ideas in group projects. There will be dedicated instructors and teaching assistants to support group work. Groups will present their results on Friday afternoon.</p>
        <p>This Summer School is primarily aimed at PhD students and postdocs who are studying or using LCA/MFA/Industrial ecology, but others (including professors and professionals) are also welcome to apply. Students who complete the school will receive a certificate for 2 ETCS credit points. Enrollment is limited to 30 people.</p>

        <h5>Location</h5>
        <p>The summer school will be held in the <a href="https://www.moeschberg.ch/">Möschberg</a> seminar hotel, in Grosshöchstetten, Switzerland. This hotel is outside the village, with views south towards the Bernese Alps. Möschberg emphasises local and organic food for its guests.</p>
        <h5>Python prerequisite</h5>
        <p>Basic understanding of Python is needed for the school. If you aren't a programmer, don't worry - most participants aren't either. You are welcome, and based on previous feedback we have adapted the course content to make the school more beginner-friendly. Please do complete a basic Python tutorial before the course, though - there are many good online options available.</p>
        <h5>Starting and ending times</h5>
        <p>The school starts with at 11:00 on Sunday, November 9th, and finishes at 16:00 on Friday, November 14th, though all students are invited to a social event on Friday evening. The course accommodations run from Sunday morning to Friday evening, and the Möschberg hotel can be booked on Friday evening for an additional fee.</p>
        <h5>Language</h5>
        <p>The summer school will be in English.</p>

        <p>Course fees includes <b>room, materials, and all meals</b> from Sunday to Friday lunch, but do not include transportation. Single room availability is limited. Full refunds are available up to October 12th, after which only 50% of the course fee will be refunded.</p>
        <p>The school is organised by <a href="https://www.d-d-s.ch/">Départ de Sentier</a>, a Swiss nonprofit association which supports open sustainability assessment and public engagement.</p>
