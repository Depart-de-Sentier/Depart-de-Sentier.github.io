        <h5>Course overview</h5>
        <p>Research in life cycle assessment and material flow analysis has exploded in the last ten years, and the power, flexibility, and availability of open source tools and data has as well. In this course, we will couple <a href="https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM">ODYM</a> and <a href="https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/">Brightway</a> can both inspire and improve the methods and results of MFA and LCA. We will also learn about open source development and publication.</p>
<!--         Can traditional Bill of Materials-based LCA inventories meet the demand for high quality decision support at scale? This Autumn School will explore alternative models for inventory creation, deployment, validation, and quality assurance. In a break from previous DdS schools, the focus will not be on Brightway and friends, but on a new tool ecosystem to be developed in 2024 focused on data exchange and compatibility, reconciliation of conflicting observations, automatic validation, and user-friendly reporting and interpretation tools. Participants in previous DdS schools are welcome to apply for this school as well.</p>
        <p>As this school will be built on software and methods under heavy development, we don't yet have a lot of detail on how everything will work. However, we do want to have (at least partial) answers for the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How can we transparently and reproducibly transform data from one ontology and nomenclature system to another?</li>
          <li>How can we reconcile multiple conflicting observations for the same product system model?</li>
          <li>How can we trace and display data lineage?</li>
          <li>How can we allow for partial dataset definition or data updates?</li>
          <li>Can we automatically generate or validate product system models using AI?</li>
          <li>What best practices can make data easily usable in advanced LCA uses cases or in other subject domains?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While exploring these questions, we will cover the scientific basis, including correlated inputs, sensitivity analysis for parsimonious models, and multiple types of uncertainty, and best practices in software architecture, including documentation standards and tools, testing, data and source version control, linting, and quick tool builders like <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> and <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">Dash</a>.</p>
 -->        <p>The structure of the school starts with two and a half days of interactive teaching sessions using Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks include exercises, and we will discuss the solutions in class. From Wednesday to Friday, you will work in groups of around six people and apply these ideas in group projects. There will be dedicated instructors and group assistants to support group work. Groups will present their results on Friday afternoon.</p>
        <p>This Summer School is primarily aimed at PhD and postdocs students who are studying or using LCA/MFA/Industrial ecology, but others are also welcome to apply. Students who complete the school will receive a certificate for 2 ETCS credit points. Enrollment is limited to 30 people.</p>

        <h5>Location</h5>
        <p>The summer school will be held on the campus of the <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> the week before the ISIE 2025 conference.</p>
        <h5>Python prerequisite</h5>
        <p>Basic understanding of Python is needed for the school. Please complete a basic Python tutorial before the course. There are many good online options available.</p>
        <h5>Starting and ending times</h5>
        <p>The school starts with at 9:00 on Monday, June 23, and finishes at 16:00 on Friday, June 27th, though all students are invited to a social event on Friday evening. The course accommodations run from Sunday evening to Saturday morning.</p>
        <h5>Language</h5>
        <p>The summer school will be in English.</p>

        <p>Invoices can be issued in EUR, using the current conversion rate. Invoices can also be paid by credit card for an additional ~3% fee.</p>
        <p>Course fees includes rooms at the NUS Singapore Hostel from the evening of Sunday, June 22 to the morning of Saturday, June 28, but <b>do not include meals</b>. Full refunds are available up to May 15th, after which only 50% of the course fee will be refunded.</p>
        <p>The school is organised by <a href="https://www.d-d-s.ch/">DÃ©part de Sentier</a>, a Swiss nonprofit association which supports open sustainability assessment and public engagement, together with NUS, the National University of Singapore.</p>
